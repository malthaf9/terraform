# Terraform
This repository is everything about terraform, like what is terraform, how to create and manage infrastructure, state files, remote backend etc..,

# What is Terraform?
-> Terraform is a Infrastructure management tool or Infrastructure as a code
-> Terraform is an open-source IAC(Infrastructure as a code) tool developed by Hashicorp

# What is terraform in breif?
-> Terraform is nothing but create and manage infrastructure on cloud providers.
-> What is Infrastructure: Infrastructure is nothing but, suppose if we want to build a house, we define how many rooms we want and what type of material we want to use, where will be the doors and windows like we manage and create this infrastructure, similarly in terraform we create and manage infrastructure like we define what type of servers we want, databases etc.., on cloud providers like AWS, Microsoft AZURE, GCP. Here cloud provider is a House and servers and databases are like rooms and material. 
-> Simply terraform is a IAC tool developed by hashicorp, which we use to create and manage infrastructure on cloud providers like AWS, AZURE, GCP

# Why We need Terraform?
-> Earlier if we want to create a EC2 instance we login to AWS and create the instance, like by using AWS CLI connect it to personal laptop, there are many ways to connect to instance i prefer AWS CLI
-> If we want to create another EC2 instance again we need to login to AWS and create instance and by AWS CLI and by EC2 instance public ip address we are connect to the instances, like here we manually do the tasks.
-> Suppose if we want to create two or three instances we can do it by manually, if we want to create 100's of instances then it takes lot of time, we can do it by manually but it takes lot of time, to automate this process we use Terraform.

# How to automate the tasks by using Terraform
-> Instead of creating manually, we can create any number of instances by just one file

steps to create:
-> First we need to create a file "main.tf" the file name will be any of our choice but the extension should be .tf
-> After creating a file write configurations that required for creating instances
